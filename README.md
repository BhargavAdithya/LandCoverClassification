# LandCoverClassification
This project uses multispectral images taken by the Landsat-8 satellite at two different times to categorize changes in land cover over time. The spectral indices—NDVI for vegetation, NDWI for water bodies, and NDBI for built-up areas—are calculated as the basis for the classification.
